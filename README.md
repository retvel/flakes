# Flakes

Nix packages by `Prompter`.

> [!WARNING]
> **DYOR (Do Your Own Research).** These packages are written largely with AI
> agents and provided as-is, without warranty. Upstream binaries are fetched
> from their official release pages and pinned by hash, but that only proves
> the download is unchanged, not that the program is safe. Read the package
> definition and the upstream project before installing, especially anything
> that runs as a system service or with root privileges.

> See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for what the pins and checks cover, and to

## Usage

```nix
{
  inputs.xr3t.url = "github:xr3t/flakes";
  inputs.xr3t.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

  # Either take packages straight from the flake (pinned nixpkgs) ...
  environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.xr3t.packages.${system}.rayfish ];

  # ... or build them against your own nixpkgs through the overlay.
  nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.xr3t.overlays.default ];
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.xr3t.rayfish ];

  # Packages with a service module:
  modules = [ inputs.xr3t.darwinModules.rayfish ];  # or nixosModules
}
```

Or run one without installing: `nix run github:xr3t/flakes#rayfish -- --version`.

## Outputs

- `packages.<system>.<name>`: only packages that build on `<system>`
- `overlays.default`: adds `pkgs.xr3t.<name>`
- `darwinModules.<name>`, `nixosModules.<name>`: for packages that have a
  `module.nix` (both), `darwin-module.nix` or `nixos-module.nix` (one only)
- `homeManagerModules.<name>`: for packages that have a `home-module.nix`
- `checks.<system>.<name>`: builds every package but the rolling
  `ghostty-tip`; `checks.<system>.formatting`
  checks that every `.nix` file is formatted, `checks.<linux>.nixos-modules`
  that the NixOS modules evaluate
- `formatter`: `nixfmt`

Systems: `aarch64-darwin`, `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-linux`.

## Updates

Packages follow upstream automatically: a workflow checks for new releases
twice a day and commits them to `main`, and the pinned nixpkgs is bumped
weekly. Pick them up with `nix flake update xr3t`. Updates of root daemons,
network filters and agents, and of nixpkgs, wait for review in a pull request
first; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for what is checked.
